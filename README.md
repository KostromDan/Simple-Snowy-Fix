# Simple Snowy Fix

This mod is multiloader port of [Simple Snowy Fix (fabric)](https://github.com/Apollounknowndev/simple-snowy-fix) by [Apollo](https://github.com/Apollounknowndev).

Despite original mod, doesn't include snow under trees feature, since it implemented well in [Snow Under Trees](https://github.com/bl4ckscor3/SnowUnderTrees) mod, with fixed many compatibility issues. Where is no reason to duplicate its function. 

## Features

In vanilla snow rarely won't generate on the leaves of trees.
It's because of Vanilla bug [MC-119599](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-119599),
If main part of tree in one chunk, but some leaves in another, snow won't generate on them.

This very simple mod fixes this issue. No dependencies, no config, just drop it in and it works.
It works out of the box with worldgen mods that add new snowy biomes as well.

If you want perfect snow I suggest also using these mods:

* [Snow Under Trees](https://github.com/bl4ckscor3/SnowUnderTrees) to let snow generate under trees.
* [Snow! Real Magic! â›„](https://github.com/Snownee/SnowRealMagic) to let grass, flowers, etc generate with snow.
